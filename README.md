# NOIP-using-algorithm
NOIP algorithm code submitted to provide easy access
This respository is continually updating

#KMP
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm to find the first occurence of one string in another.

##Input
Two strings, the partial string and the whole string

##Output
The index of first occurence of partial string in the whole string (starting from 0)

#MaxFlow
The Edmond-Karp algorithm dealing with the Network Flow problem

## Input
First Line: N R S D

N: the number of Vertexs in the graph

R: the number of tunnels in the graph

S: the start vertex of the transmission (presented as vertex identifier ranging from 0 to N - 1)

D: the destiniation vertex of the transmission

Next R Lines: s d c (represents a single tunnel)


s: the start vertex of this tunnel

d: the end vertex of this tunnel

c: the capacity of the tunnel

##Output
The Maximum flow of things that can be transmitted from S to D
